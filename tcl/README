Instructions for parse_props_nets.tcl script

This script extracts MGT and COMMON modules attributes and nets from a synthesized Vivado project. 
How to use:
Use Vivado Transceiver Wizard to generate the MGT IP with the configuration that you need to implement as an MGT Builder protocol
Open example design for that IP from inside Vivado
Synthesize the example and open the synthesized design
Using TCL console in Vivado cd into directory where you want to place generated files with MGT attributes and nets
Execute this command in Vivado Tcl console: set args "YOUR GTs CELL NAME PATTERNS"; source /path/to/parse_props_nets.tcl
Example: set args "GTYE4_CHANNEL GTYE4_COMMON"; source /path/to/parse_props_nets.tcl
Command must be single line, as shown above
args may include more than one item, such as channel and common modules
The resulting attributes and nets will be written into separate files for each item
Output files are created in the directory that Vivado is currently in 
Use pwd command in TCL console to find which directory is it if you forgot
Import generated files directly into Excel spreadsheets for the corresponding protocol
